# Fanorona

Fanorona is a Malagasy chess game. In this project, I propose to invent a fanorona with an artificial intelligence implemented with C ++ based on the "Alpha-beta pruning" algorithm. Here is a screenshot of the demonstration. 

If you want to test my application, just clone the repository then run one of the .exe files, enjoy the game and don't hesitate to send me your comments.
